Crypto Day Trading Strategy: 10 EMA / 5 SMA Counter-Trend Architect


1. Strategy Overview
This document outlines the architecture for an automated, short-term cryptocurrency trading strategy. The primary goal is to capture profits from short-term pullbacks by systematically entering trades when the price deviates from its immediate trend, anticipating a reversion to the mean.


* Strategy Type: Mean-Reversion / Counter-Trend Scalping
* Core Indicators: 5-period SMA (Fast) and 10-period EMA (Slow)
* Target Timeframe: 1-Minute
* Core Concept: This strategy operates on the principle that when a slow-moving average crosses above a fast-moving average, it signifies a short-term price dip. The strategy enters a buy order during this dip, anticipating that the price will "revert" and move back up.


2. Core Trading Logic: Signals
The foundation of the strategy is the inverse interaction between the 5 SMA and the 10 EMA on the 1-minute timeframe.
* Primary Buy Signal (Entry):
   * A buy order is triggered when the 10-period EMA (slow) crosses decisively above the 5-period SMA (fast).
   * Confirmation: To avoid false signals, the trade is not placed at the exact moment of the cross. Instead, we wait for the candle on which the crossover occurred to close. The entry happens at the opening price of the very next candle.
* Primary Sell Signal (Exit):
   * The position is closed when the 10-period EMA crosses back below the 5-period SMA.
   * Confirmation: Similar to the entry, the exit is triggered only after the crossover candle has fully closed.






3. Essential Filter: Volatility Confirmation
In a mean-reversion strategy, a trend filter can be counterproductive. Instead, we want to ensure there is enough market volatility for a "reversion" to be profitable. Trading in a flat, low-volatility market is undesirable.
* Filter Concept: Avoid trading when the market is flat.
* Rule:
   * A buy signal is only considered valid if the distance (spread) between the 10 EMA and a longer-term EMA (e.g., 50-period) is above a certain threshold.
   * If the moving averages are tightly bundled together, it indicates a sideways market, and all buy signals are ignored. This prevents entering trades that have little room to move.
4. Risk Management Framework
This is the most critical component of the architecture. Trading without it is unsustainable.
* Position Sizing:
   * The 1% Rule: No single trade will risk more than 1% of the total trading capital. For example, on a $5,000 account, the maximum loss on any given trade will be capped at $50.
* Primary Safety Exit (Soft Stop-Loss):
   * The main exit condition for any open position is the 10-period EMA crossing back below the 5-period SMA. This acts as a dynamic stop-loss that adapts to market momentum.
* Dynamic Profit-Lock Stop-Loss:
   * This rule activates only after TP1 is hit.
   * Once the first take-profit order at +1.5% is executed, a hard stop-loss order for the remaining half of the position is immediately placed at +0.5% relative to the original entry price.
   * This ensures that, at a minimum, the second half of the trade closes with a small profit, preventing a winning trade from becoming a loss.
* Take-Profit (TP) Grid:
   * Upon entry, the position is divided into two equal parts to allow for scaling out of the trade.
   * TP1: The first part of the position will be closed automatically when the price reaches +1.5% profit from the entry price.
   * TP2: The second part of the position will be closed automatically when the price reaches +2.5% profit from the entry price.
5. System Architecture Blueprint
For automation, the strategy is broken down into distinct, interacting modules:
1. Data Handler:
   * Function: Connects to the cryptocurrency exchange's API (e.g., Binance, Coinbase Pro).
   * Responsibility: Fetches real-time and historical price data (candlesticks) for the chosen crypto asset on the 1m timeframe.
2. Strategy & Signal Generator:
   * Function: The "brain" of the operation.
   * Responsibility: Receives data from the Data Handler. It calculates the 5 SMA and 10 EMA. It constantly checks for the inverse crossover conditions and applies the volatility filter. When a valid trade setup is identified, it generates a signal (e.g., "BUY: BTC/USD").
3. Portfolio & Risk Manager:
   * Function: Manages capital and risk exposure.
   * Responsibility: Receives the signal from the Strategy module. It calculates the appropriate position size based on the 1% rule. It approves or denies the trade based on available capital and risk parameters.
4. Execution Handler:
   * Function: The "hands" of the operation.
   * Responsibility: Receives the approved trade order. It places the initial buy order and immediately places the two separate take-profit orders (TP1 and TP2). It then monitors the trade. If TP1 is executed, it immediately places the Dynamic Profit-Lock Stop-Loss order at +0.5% for the remaining position. It also continuously monitors for the soft stop-loss condition (the EMA crossover).
5. Main Loop (Orchestrator):
   * Function: The "heartbeat" of the system.
   * Responsibility: Runs continuously, triggering the other modules in a logical sequence. On the close of each new candle, it initiates the process: fetch data -> analyze for signals -> manage risk -> execute trade.
6. Conclusion & Next Steps
This architecture provides a comprehensive blueprint for a counter-trend scalping strategy based on a 10 EMA / 5 SMA inverse crossover. It is designed to buy on dips and scale out of positions as profit targets are met, with a dynamic stop-loss to lock in profits on the second half of the trade.
